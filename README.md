# openGLExperiments
This project is my own experimentations with the OpenGL API. I'm currently following and using a lot of boilerplate code from this tutorial series: https://github.com/VictorGordan/opengl-tutorials

Breakdown
-
Right now this project features:
- Texture importing
- Specular, normal and displacement texture maps
- Parallax occlusion mapping
- Point, directional and spot lights

I wanted to learn the OpenGL API to take a step up from making shaders in Shadertoy. I was curious about what went under the hood and felt like I missed out on not being able to recreate the same effects from scratch. Part of this journey was quickly learning OOP and C++ beforehand.

The project uses libraries from glfw, glad, glm (for matrix math), stb (for loading images).
